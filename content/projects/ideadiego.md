## Portfolio website

In this website I write about what I do.

Posts and projects have tags, you can click on them to filter posts and projects with those tags.

In the home page there is a <a href="https://d3-graph-gallery.com/wordcloud.html">word cloud</a> based on how many tags there are of any topic, the more tags the bigger the word.

Actually I save my tags with a multiplier, for instance this project has a tag nuxt but in the code says `nuxt 3` and for the tag javascript says `javascript 1` so nuxt its 3 times more relevant than javascript for this post and therefore for the word cloud.

I used the library <a href="https://github.com/makeupsomething/vue-d3-cloud">vue-d3-cloud</a>

In the post <nuxt-link to="/posts/hello-world">hello-world</nuxt-link> I wrote about why I moved from ruby on rails to nuxt
